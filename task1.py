# Task nr.1
# Create a program witch takes 5 different (minmum)  variables containing strings for username and password. 
# The string should look like : "username='', password=''; username='',password='';....etc" 
# Start Endless loop allowing to enter username and password and check ff credentials are correct stop endless loop and print greeting message, 
# otherwise print 'wrong credentials' and ask to enter password and username again. The program should show numbers of times you tried to enter both credentials.

# For storing account information use dict , all data should be lowercase. and extra symbols (@, %, $ etc and numbers). 
# If in password numbers or symbols are not provided, the program should add additional value to dictionary as a value, names 'improved password'
