#  #Python Loops (ciklai)
# Python has two primitive loop commands:

# while loops
# for loops

# # While loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# i = 0
# while i < 10:   # kol
#   print(i)
#   i += 1    # sutrumpinta i = i + 1

# Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.

# # endless loops
# This loop will not allow user to pass empty space as argument, will always wait until something is typed.

# while True:
#     user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
#     if len(user_input) != 0:
#         break
# print(f"You entered {user_input }")
